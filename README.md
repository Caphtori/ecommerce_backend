# ecommerce_backend

## Description
A backend framework for an ecommerce site.  Allows users to view, create, update and delete from categories, products, and tags.

## Installation
Download the repo.  Install npm if needed.

## Usage
To create database, navigate to db folder, log into mysql, and run the command, "source schema.sql".  To seed database, navigate back into the project folder and run the command, "npm run seed".  To start the server, run the command, "npm run start".

Connect to front end infrastructure.  Use api calls for get, post, put, and delete routes.  If no backend, use Insomnia.
